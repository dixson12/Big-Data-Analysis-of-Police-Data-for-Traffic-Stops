# Big-Data-Analysis-of-Police-Data-for-Traffic-Stops
By performing this analysis, I demonstrated skills in data handling, data analysis, and data visualization using Python and pandas. This project showcases my ability to work with big data sets and derive meaningful insights to inform decision-making processes.
1-Analyzed a large-scale police data set containing over 60,000 records to gain insights into traffic stops and related factors.
2-Explored various aspects of the data, such as the distribution of violations, gender disparities in speeding violations, the impact of gender on search rates during stops, and the mean duration of stops.
3-Conducted statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data, including comparing the age distribution across different types of violations.
